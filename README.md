Easy Gate is a simple web application built in Go and React that acts as the home page for your self-hosted infrastructure. Services and notes are parsed from a JSON file in real-time (without restarting the application). Services and notes can be assigned to one or more groups to show items only to specific users (based on their connecting IP addresses).

## Deployment

Easy Gate can be deployed on any server that supports Docker. If your infrastructure is running behind a configured nginx instance, it is recommended to read the **Docker Compose (with nginx)** section.
